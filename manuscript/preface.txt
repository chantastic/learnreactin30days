# Preface

The hardest part of learning JavaScript is picking an entry point.

JavaScript is likely the language you're stuck with. I definitely didn't want to be a JavaScript developer. Other languages seem so clear. You write code, run it, and it does something. JavaScript is inextricably bound to event; you write code and it waits for you.

I was stuck with JavaScript. I tried to be stay "a designer" and keep in the HTML/CSS wheelhouse. But JavaScript got it's tenticles around me. You can't design for todays web without interactivity. And interactivity on the web means JavaScript. Littly by little, I figured out just enough jQuery to do better desigens. Now, I write JavaScript all day.

If you're reading this book, you're probably on a similar path. So, let me tell you why you should consider React.

I like React because it makes user inteface development more predictable. It's small, everything is contained in logical components, and you get reliable errors.

If you're doing UI development in HTML, CSS, and jQuery, this book is for you. It's a bootcamp for understanding the way React works and why it's a great tool for UI developers.

The chapters are short with lots of examples. I recommend following it from start to finish nad then keeping it around as a reference. I still do.

Thanks for reading.
