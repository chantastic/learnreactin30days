# Day 1: render

`React.render` is where most React applications start.  `render` is used to place a component somewhere on the document. Think it it like so:

```
React.render(/* What */, /* Where */);
```

Let's answer those questions, starting with "where".

React will take any DOM element. To keep things simple, let's render our component into `document.body`.

```
React.render(/* What */, document.body);
```

Now let's answer the what.

React has made components of all the HTML elements, available in the `React.DOM` object. We can create HTML elements like `div`, `span`, and `h1`, by using `React.DOM.div`, `React.DOM.span`, and `React.DOM.h1`.

Now let's use `React.DOM` to answer the "what".

```
React.render(React.DOM.h1({}, 'Hi React'), document.body);
```

You should now see "Hi React" rendered out in your browser.

#### Why the empty object as a first argument?

React components take a number of arguments that give you control over element attributes and data. We'll cover that in future lessons. For now, add it in blind faith.
