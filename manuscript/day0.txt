# Day 0: A Simple React Setup

We'll start with a basic HTML page. This setup will be the basis for the early examples in this book.

```
<!doctypes html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script src="https://fb.me/react-0.13.3.js"></script>
    <script>

      // your code here
      console.log(React);

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's talk this it.

We have a very basic HTML document with two script tags. The first loads the `react` library and the second is where we'll write our code.

Below that we have a script tag where our code will go. Right now it's logging out the `React` to the browser's dev console.
