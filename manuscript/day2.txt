# Day 2 createElement

Let's talk about `React.DOM`. It has a few limitations, mostly that only has components that math HTML elemenents. We can't add to `React.DOM`. We can't do this:

```js
React.render(React.DOM.greeting({}, "Bob");
```

For this, we've have `createElement`. `createElement` allows us to use components that we've defined as well as the standard set of HTML elements.

We can write the same example as yesterday using `createElement`:

```js
React.render(React.createElement('div', {}, 'Hi React'), document.body);
```

Note that this time, we're using 'div' as an argument. Once we learn how to create React components (tomorrow), we can replace 'div' with the name of our custom component.
